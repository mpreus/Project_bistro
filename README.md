# Project_bistro
Still simple landing page of a bar though containing sub-sites with menu and location info respectively
Buttons allow users redirect from one sub-site to another
My main affort was to use a single CSS style file for the main page and its two sub-sites. 
In this way I intend to set the same graphic design in the whole project
